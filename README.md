## How to use GitHub
GitHub is basically a big place to store files and versions of them. You have a main branch, basically like the Alpha Timeline where everything certain happens. You can [FORK](https://github.com/ixnoahlive/kankricap/fork) this main branch into your own repository (which is a big file system) to edit the files inside. After you're done, you can open a [PULL REQUEST](https://github.com/ixnoahlive/kankricap/pulls) to pull your offshoot branch/timeline back into the main one. Once approved, it'll merge back in and your changes will be there! yay! :D

If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask! <3

If you would like to be added as a contributor (someone who can merge branches), please give me a ping (@ixnoah in the HS Discord)! Some Git experience would be nice!
